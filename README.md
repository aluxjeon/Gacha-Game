# Alex's CPSC 210 Term Project

## Description of Project:
The application will be a gacha game where the user can pulls for characters and use them to fight enemies. 
This project is of interest to me because I love gacha gamesâ€”the one I've played the longest thus far is Genshin
Impact. I also think this would be a really cool way for me to integrate art into code since I draw in my free time! 
Moreover, I think a gacha game sufficiently covers all the criteria of this term project since gacha games are about 
collecting characters and items, all of which is data that needs to be saved.
